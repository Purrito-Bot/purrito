To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Emissary</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Pilgrim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Exile</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Sightseer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Fugitive</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Wanderer</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Where Are You From?</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign.
